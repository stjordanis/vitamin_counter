then compile the program with this command:
```sh install.sh```

start the program with this command:
```sh start.sh```

if you want to add more foods to the program, enter the data in src/data.erl.
It should conform to the units in docs/essential.md


Notes on Choline:
If your diet contains excess folate and methionine, then your liver can produce choline, and you possibly don't need dietary choline.
Doctors aren't sure if dietary Choline is necessary, or good, or harmful.

Warning:
Use this product at your own risk. It likely has mistakes inside of it. Nutrition is an inexact science, everybody is different, we all have unique needs.
